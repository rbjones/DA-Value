Developing a platform for value refinement and effective implementation.

This is a sister project to DA-Hol, and will build on that project, but in these early stages the aim is to provide a corresponding "Manifesto" articulating the ambition, its philosophical basis, the architecture of the proposed solution and the strategy for its implementation.

All this will go in the project wiki which will be gradually written concurrently with work on DA-Hol here at Github.
There is a gitter chat room for discussing these ideas.
